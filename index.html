<p> <strong> Introduction </strong> </p>
<p> The Covid-19 lockdowns during 2020 had a large impact on the US labor market. Using MySQL for analysis and Javascript for data modeling, 
  we can see how unenployment rose, find which industries were affected the most, and see if any companies found success during this time.

In 2011, Massachusetts had just under 300,000 unemployed residents. <br>
<br> After 8 years of a steady decline,
the unemployment rate rose to 16.4% in April of 2020, with over half a million 
unemployed Massachusetts residents. <br><br> One year later, the unemployment rate fell back to 6.4%,
which is still higher than the 2.7% unemployment rate just before lockdown.

<p> Looking at 14 different industries in the US, we can see the effects of the lockdown across the labor force. The industry
  affected least by lockdowns was the information sector with just a 9% decrease in available jobs. Following next is the wholesale trade industry
  with a 12% decrease and government employment with an 18% decrease.

The leisure and hospitality industry experienced the strongest imapct during the months of lockdown. <br>
<br> In early 2020, there were around 1,000,000 available jobs in the industry. In March that 
number decreased to around 300,000. <br><br>

<strong> After the lockdowns were lifted, the number of vacant service job positions rose to 1.8 million by the beginning of 2021. </strong>
<br><br> This shows a 500% increase between March 2020 and January 2021.

    <p> In recent years, we have seen a rise in service app employment. Anyone can apply for jobs such as 
     Uber driver, in-store grocery shooper, etc. with just a smartphone and a car without setting foot in a work place. With Covid-19
     lockdowns, people were drawn to work in these industries to supplement any lost income. <br> <br> <Strong> Instacart is a grocery delivery app that experienced
       employment growth during lockdown.

    <p style="margin-left: 20px; color: rgb(99, 96, 96);"> <strong> Figure 5 </strong> - Instacart Employment Growth </p>
    <div id="figure5"> <img src="images/Instacart_shoppers.PNG"></div>
    <div id="text5"> <p> 
    Instacart was founded in 2014 and accumulated slightly over 100,000 in store shoppers over their first five years in buisness. <br>
    <br><strong> After the Covid-19 lockdowns, Instacart's employment increased by 285% </strong>
    <br><br>
    With people wanting to avoid crowded spaces such as grocery stores, many opted to order their groceries online.
    This huge demand in grocery deliveries combined with job layoffs contributed to Instacart's success during Covid-19.
